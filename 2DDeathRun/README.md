To run the app, simply download the builds folder and click 2DDeathRun.exe
Player moves with arrow keys and space, player 2 uses 'Q'

This game was made with inspiration from gmod's deathrun where one player takes control of the traps,
clicking a button to activate them and preventing other players from reaching the end.

In my version, the 2 player aspect is dumbed down as the player will only need to press the 'Q' button to activate traps. 
Implementation of animations, timings, movement, jump height based off how long the spacebar is being pressed, were the highlights of the project
